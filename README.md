# About
WireFrames is a collection of encapsulated Kyma Sounds, encapsulated Classes and Examples created by Gustav Scholda and Cristian Vogel at [NeverEngineLabs](https://www.neverenginelabs.com) . The Classes have been designed to work together, with shared key concepts, in order to allow a user to explore the advanced method of signal domain programming in Kyma. In other words, this means programming signals with other signals, instead of scripted text-based programming. 

The WireFrames library can be powerful and efficient and it is best a good way for the user to learn an alternative approach to Kyma programming. In this approach, we don't work with Capytalk scripting that much (although you can still use Capytalk everywhere in our Classes).
The bulk of WireFrames programming is done by manipulating the values of individual samples directly inside the signal processor - _the Wire_.
To do this, we define a container to hold a fixed length of sample points - _the Frame_.

In the Library you will find tools that are useful for debugging signals, essentially customised Oscilloscope objects. 

**IMPORTANT!** 
Wiring up audio for use as _control_ signals in the studio, means that you may encounter situations which can result in a very loud undesired sound being routed to the speakers - essentially raw samples intended for control not listening which can be dangerous to ears and speakers. 



**BE CAREFUL**. Think before you press play. Turn down speakers first just in case.
