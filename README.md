#WireFrames 

WireFrames is a collection of encapsulated [Kyma](kyma.symbolicsound.com/) Sounds ( Classes ) and Examples. The Classes have been designed to work together, with shared key concepts, in order to allow a user to explore an advanced method of signal programming in Kyma.
The WireFrames library can be powerful and efficient but it requires the user to learn an alternative approach to Kyma programming. In this approach, we don't work with Capytalk scripting that much (although you can still use Capytalk everywhere in our Classes).
The bulk of WireFrames programming is done by manipulating the values of individual samples directly inside the signal processor - _the Wire_.
To do this, we define a container to hold a fixed length of sample points - _the Frame_.
